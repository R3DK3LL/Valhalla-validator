## Assessment Framework

VALHALLA evaluates software architectures across established engineering dimensions:

| Component | Weight | Focus Areas |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Frontend Architecture** | 10% | Component design, state management, user experience |
| **Backend Services** | 20% | API design, service architecture, data validation |
| **Data Management** | 15% | Database design, caching, persistence patterns |
| **DevOps Pipeline** | 15% | Build automation, testing, deployment strategies |
| **Infrastructure** | 15% | Cloud architecture, scalability, orchestration |
| **Monitoring & Observability** | 10% | Logging, metrics, alerting, performance tracking |
| **Security & Compliance** | 10% | Authentication, authorization, data protection |
| **Data Services** | 5% | Analytics, processing pipelines, model deployment |

## Current API Status

## Architecture Assessment Engine

The platform employs proprietary evaluation algorithms to assess software architectures against industry standards and best practices. The assessment framework:

- **Multi-dimensional Analysis** - Evaluates across 8 critical architecture domains
- **Weighted Scoring** - Applies industry-standard importance weights to different components
- **Quality Thresholds** - Enforces configurable quality gates for deployment readiness
- **Gap Analysis** - Identifies specific areas requiring improvement with actionable recommendations

## Language Model Integration

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Integration-Development-orange.svg)

Planned support for leading AI providers through user-supplied API keys:

- **OpenAI GPT Models** - Advanced technical analysis and reasoning
- **Anthropic Claude** - Detailed architectural planning and documentation
- **Google Gemini** - Pattern recognition and multi-modal analysis

The platform will apply quality control mechanisms to ensure AI-generated outputs meet professional architecture standards.

## Security & Intellectual Property

- **Proprietary Assessment Logic** - Core evaluation algorithms protected via encryption
- **Secure Key Management** - Environment-based secret management with rotation
- **Zero-Trust Design** - No sensitive evaluation criteria exposed in public repositories  
- **Memory-Only Processing** - Sensitive algorithms decrypted in memory during execution
